# **App Name**: Gitlab Navigator

## Core Features:

- Repository Browser: Browse repositories with an intuitive UI. Display file structures, commit history, and branches.
- Commit Viewer: Display the diffs associated with a commit.
- Branch Management: List, create, and switch branches within the UI.
- Issue Tracker Integration: Fetch and display issues and merge requests from Gitlab's API. This feature leverages AI to prioritize issues based on relevance to your current branch.
- Code Search: Allows users to search for code across all repositories they have access to.
- AI-Powered Code Assistant Tool: Provide inline code suggestions and assistance using a generative AI model. The LLM uses a tool to fetch project details and existing coding conventions, making the output specific to your gitlab instance. This is used when it has enough relevant information and it's contextually appropriate.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: GitLab Blue (#FCA311) for a strong association with Gitlab's brand. Based on the brand and community-focused nature of the application, a vibrant and energetic tone will be reflected in the colors.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), nearly desaturated version of GitLab Blue, providing a neutral backdrop to emphasize content.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#FFB347) to highlight interactive elements.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a modern, friendly sans-serif.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', used to create hierarchy and for its computerized look that adds a modern feel
- Use icons from a consistent set, related to file types, actions (commit, push, pull), and status indicators.
- Employ a clean and structured layout with a sidebar for navigation and a main content area for code browsing and editing.
- Use subtle transitions and animations for UI elements like dropdown menus, file explorers, and loading states to enhance the user experience.
